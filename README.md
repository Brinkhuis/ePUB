# Create ebooks in ePUB format with Python 
![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/d/d1/EPub_logo.png)

This repo is the result of a 'lazy sunday python project', so no warranties and for educational purposes only.  

Books converted to the [ePub](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ebook/) format are:
- King James Version (English)
- Statenvertaling (Dutch)
- Statenvertaling - editie Gereformeerde Bijbelstichting (Dutch)

The ideas was to get some free texts from the web and save them as `CSV` files.
Based on these `CSV` files a standard procedure can be followed to generate `epub` files.

If you have suggestions for other translations or for code optimizations, please open an issue.

_Happy coding and reading!_
