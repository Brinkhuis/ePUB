# Create ebooks in ePUB format with Python 
![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/d/d1/EPub_logo.png)

This repo is the result of a 'lazy sunday python project', so no warranties and for educational purposes only.  

Books converted to the [ePub](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ebook/) format are:
- Alice in Wonderland
- King James Bible
- Statenvertaling (Dutch)

The ideas was to get some free texts from the web and save them as `html` files.
Based on these `html` files a standard procedure can be followed to generate and `epub` from these files.

- Alice in Wonderland was a great little book to try as it has some pictures too.  
- The King James Bible and Statenvertaling (Dutch) were great for testing with more 'chunky' books.

If you have suggestions for other books or for code optimizations, please open an issue.

_Happy coding and reading!_
